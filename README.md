Web3.0 Recruitment task - Pratham Sahu

Problem 1:

1. The loaning service program is written in c++ and uses the features of OOPS.
2. The Lender and Borrower are implemented using seperate classes and a derived class Prepayment_Borrower is used to implement the prepayment of loans. This derived class uses inheritence.
3. Constructors are used and the parametrised constructor of parent class is also called during the constructor call of base class.

The program is a self explanatory menu-driven loaning service. It calculates the emi payable for different scenarios and also the new emi on prepayment of a loan. It also helps a lender find out the profits made by lending money.


Problem 2:
The loaning system implemented is a centralised loaning system as all the data and functionality is controlled by a single powerful entity. The user has to trust this entity with his private data and has no other choice. The entire power is in the hands of the loaning service.
 
The Demerits of a centralised loaning system are: 

1. The user has to trust the centralised entity with his/her data and their promise of providing the required service.
2. Centralised systems have to deal with frauds and forgery.
3. It does not gaurentee transparency and many times the customer is tricked by the centralised entity.
4. The contracts are mutable and subject to many conditions and thus can be violated.
