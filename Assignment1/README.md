Imported the hashlib library in python to implement hashing in SHA256

Ran a while loop to add the nonce until the hash was lesser than required target value.

Found out time using the time library provided by python.


Input: "iitk"

Output: 

       ('hashed ', '00000bde24704b17d1531816354d01810b1e6f01b1ea38e0c53d5fc5f3bfd70a')
        ('nonce ', 1217060)
        ('time taken ', 1.8172569274902344)
